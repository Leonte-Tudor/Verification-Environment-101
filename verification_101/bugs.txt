Bugs:

- Reset sets the empty flag to 0 instead of 1. Minor issue, easily fixable;

- The module still operates in all modes with reset high, because there are 2 separate always blocks for clk and reset. There should be only one with if's;

- It doesn't check if there are multiple chips enabled. If there are, it still works, could be a feature if specified;

- STACK_SIZE is not configurable via parameter;

- Pushing works when both push and pop are high;

- If we select mode = 3, previous outputs linger, probably not desirable.
